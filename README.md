# Analyze population data
The "Adult Income Census" dataset, sourced from Kaggle, is a crucial dataset in the field of data analysis and income prediction. This dataset includes information about individuals, such as age, gender, job type, education level, marital status, occupation, and other details, along with their income levels.

This project will conduct a thorough analysis of the "Adult Income Census" dataset to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing an individual's income. By doing so, the team aims to gain insights into the key factors that determine income levels and identify complex patterns and relationships among the variables.

To perform this analysis, the team will use popular data science tools and libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data processing and analysis. Visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn will also be employed to better understand the distribution of the data and the relationships between variables.

Through this analysis, the team hopes to provide valuable insights into the factors affecting income and offer guidance for learning and research in the fields of data analysis and income prediction. Additionally, the team seeks to create opportunities for learning and expanding knowledge in their field of study.
